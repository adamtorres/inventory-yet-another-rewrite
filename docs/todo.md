# Comparing the previous version to this version

- [ ] Saved searches
  - Where should the search be?  Item, SourceItem, OrderLineItem, all three?
    - Item: Makes sense when doing general lookups
    - SourceItem: Makes some sense when looking for a price as it would show all orders of the SourceItem.
      - Makes more sense for when the actual counting inventory is working as the user wouldn't have to care about the
      order date; the system would just pick oldest available item first.
    - OrderLineItem: Makes sense currently when looking for a price as we could go directly to the correct order date.
